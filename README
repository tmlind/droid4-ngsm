droid4-ngsm ts27010 utility

This program initializes ts27010 line discipline on droid 4 modem uart
so other programs such as ModemManager and ofono can use the /dev/gsmtty*
ports.

At some point n_gsm will probably be initialized by a Linux kernel serdev
driver, so any code using /dev/gsmtty* ports should already assume that
the ports may already be initialized.

This program may add support to proxy some of the ts27010 channels needed
to use the W3GLTE modem in addition to the MDM6600 modem. And it may at
some point have support to send AT commands to the ts27010 channels from
command line for testing.

For now it can be just used initialize the line discipline. And make a
speaker phone test call after setting alsamixer to "Call" and doing:

$ droid4-ngsm --call=123456789

Then just hit Ctrl-C when done.

To debug what AT commands Android is using, you can do the following:

# echo 0x7fffffff > /sys/module/ts27010mux/parameters/debug_level
# dmesg | grep ts27010 | grep AT
ts27010: >C 3025AT+COPS?
ts27010: >C 3026AT+CREG?
...

Note that with n_gsm you need to use the DLCI numbers, not the device
numbers used by the ts27010 driver. So DLCI 1 means /dev/gsmtty1, while
ts27010 driver uses /dev/mux0 for DLCI1.
